<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Reverse engineering is the process of taking an app apart to find out how it works,whether itâ€™s a physical object such as a lock or in this case,a mobile application.Decompiling is a form of reverse engineering in which a mobile app is analyzed by looking at its source code. A decompiler program examines the binary and translates its contents from a low-level abstraction to a higher-level abstraction.You can do this by examining the compiled app(static analysis), observing the app during runtime (dynamic analysis),or a combination of both.

An Android binary is called an APK, which stands for Android Package Kit.The APK contains application data in the form of zipped Dalvik Executable (.dex) files.

DEX files consist of the following components:

File Header
String Table
Class List
Field Table
Method Table
Class Definition Table
Field List
Method List
Code Header
Local Variable List

### Built With

* [Python3]
* [C & C++]
* [Shell Script]
